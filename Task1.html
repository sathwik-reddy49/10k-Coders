                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <pre><h3>Fake currency detection</h3>
                    •Developed a system for counterfeit currency detection using Computer Vision (CVV)
                    and Regression Analysis (REG).
                    •Implemented algorithms to analyze visual features and detect discrepancies indicative
                    of fake currency.
                    •Achieved high accuracy and reliability, significantly improving verification processes
                    for financial institutions.
                    <h3>Sorting Visualizer</h3>
                    •Developed an interactive Sorting Visualizer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
                    demonstrate various sorting algorithms.
                    •Implemented multiple sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort,Quick
                    Sort, and Insertion Sort with real-time visual feedback.
                    •Created a user-friendly interface with controls to adjust array size and sorting speed,
                    providing an engaging learning tool for users.
                    <h3>Student Management System</h3>
                    •Developed a Student Management System using Python and MySQL to handle student
                    data efficiently.
                    •Implemented CRUD operations for managing student records, including adding,
                    updating, and deleting information.
                    •Created advanced search and filter features to easily retrieve and manage student
                    information.
